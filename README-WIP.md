# Gaze

## What is Gaze?

Gaze runs a command, **right after** you saved something.

## How is it useful?

Software development sometimes forces us to execute the same command again and again by hands.

Let's say, you started writing a really really really simple Python script. You created a.py, wrote 5 lines of code and run "python a.py".
Since the result was not perfect, you edited a.py again, and run "python a.py" again.

Again and again...

Before you realized, you've saved the same files and executes the same command thousands of times!

Gaze runs a command Instead of you, **right after** you edit files.

### Use cases:

ðŸš€**Right after** you save a script(e.g. Python), Gaze runs the script

You can also use Gaze for these purposes:

- ðŸš€**Right after** you save a Ruby script, Gaze runs tests
- ðŸš€**Right after** you save JavaScript files, Gaze runs linter
- ðŸš€**Right after** you save Dockerfile, Gaze runs "docker build ."
- And so forth...

## How to use Gaze
