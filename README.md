# Gaze

## What is Gaze?

Gaze runs a command, **right after** you saved something.

## Features:

- Easy to run
- React you file modifications super quickly
- Useful options
  - timeout(useful if you sometimes write infinite loops)
  - restart(useful for server applications)
- Language-agnostic
  - It has useful default configurations for some languages

## Use cases:

ðŸš€Gaze runs a script, **Right after** you save it(e.g. Python),

You can also use Gaze for these purposes:

- ðŸš€Gaze runs tests, **Right after** you save a Ruby script
- ðŸš€Gaze runs linter, **Right after** you save a JavaScript file
- ðŸš€Gaze runs "docker build .", **Right after** you save Dockerfile
- And so forth...

---

Software development sometimes forces us to execute the same command again and again, by hands!

Let's say, you started writing a really really really simple Python script. You created a.py, wrote 5 lines of code and run "python a.py".
Since the result was not perfect, you edited a.py again, and run "python a.py" again.

Again and again...

Before you realized, you've saved the same files and executes the same command thousands of times!

Gaze runs a command Instead of you, **right after** you edit files.

# Installation

# How to use Gaze

The top priority of the Gaze's design is "easy to invoke".

By this command, gaze starts watching the files in the current directory.

```
gaze .
```

### Other examples:

Gaze at one file.

```
gaze a.py
```

Gaze at subdirectories. Runs a modified file.

```
gaze 'src/**/*.rb'
```

Gaze at subdirectories. Runs a fixed command.

```
gaze 'src/**/*.js' -c "npm run lint"
```

Kill an ongoing process, every time before it runs the next(Useful when you are writing servers)

```
gaze -r server.py
```

Kill an ongoing process, after 1000(ms)(Useful when you like to write infinite loops)

```
gaze -t 1000 complicated.py
```

### Configuration

Gaze is Language-agnostic.

But it has useful default configurations for some languages.

Due to the default configurations, the command below is valid.

```
gaze a.py
```

By default, it is the same as:

```
gaze a.py -c 'python "{{file}}"'
```

Gaze searches a configuration file according to it's priority rule.

- Specify using -y option
- ./gaze.yml
- ~/.gaze.yml
- (Default)

You can display the default configuration by running `gaze -y`.

```yaml
commands:
  - ext: .go
    run: go run "{{file}}"
  - ext: .py
    run: python "{{file}}"
  - ext: .rb
    run: ruby "{{file}}"
  - ext: .js
    run: node "{{file}}"
  - ext: .d
    run: dmd -run "{{file}}"
  - ext: .groovy
    run: groovy "{{file}}"
  - ext: .php
    run: php "{{file}}"
  - ext: .pl
    run: perl "{{file}}"
  - ext: .java
    run: java "{{file}}"
  - ext: .kts
    run: kotlinc -script "{{file}}"
  - re: ^Dockerfile$
    run: docker build -f "{{file}}" .
```

You're able to have your own configuration very easily.

```
gaze -y > ~/.gaze.yml
vi ~/.gaze.yml
```

### Options:

```

Usage: gaze [options...] file(s)

Options:
-c A command string.
-r Restart mode. Send SIGKILL to a ongoing process before invoking next.
-t Timeout(ms) Send SIGKILL to a ongoing process after this time.
-q Quiet mode.
-f Specify a YAML configuration file.
-c Color(0:plain, 1:colorful)
-v Verbose mode.
-h Display help.

```

### Command format

You can specify a mustache style template as a command.

```

gaze -c 'go run "{{file}}"'

```
